Python
Python is high-level general purppose language


Keyword
Keyword is reserverd word in python (total 35) which can't use for the variable, function or any other identifier.


Namespace
namespace is system which has unique name for every object. Object might be variable or function.
python itself maintain namespace in the form of dictionary.
e.g. namespace as dictionary where keys are the object and values are the object themselves

Types of namespaces :
- Built-in namespace	(print(), type(), id())
- Global namespace 		(defined in global in program)
- Local namespace		(defined in local within function in program)


Variable:
variable is containers which stores the values
variable is symbolic name in python which refer the reference of the particular data type object
python is dynamic typed, we are not defined data type to the variable, we just assign variable name to the particular data type.


Operator:
python operator used to perform an operation on variables/objects.
	OPERATORS: These are the special symbols. Eg- + , * , /, etc.
	OPERAND: It is the value on which the operator is applied
	

Types of operators in python:
- Arithmetic	(+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
	precedence:
		P – Parentheses
		E – Exponentiation
		M – Multiplication (Multiplication and division have the same precedence)
		D – Division
		A – Addition (Addition and subtraction have the same precedence)
		S – Subtraction

- Logical		(and, or, not)
	precedence: 
		not - and - or
		
- Bitwise		(&, |, ~, ^, >>, <<)
	precedence: 
		~, shift(>>,<<), &, ^, |
		
- Comparision	(>, <, ==, !=, >=, <=)
	precedence:
		All the operators within comparison operators have same precedence order.

- Assignment	(=, +=, -=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=)

- Identity		(is, is not)

- Membership	(in, not in)

- Ternary operator (testing a condition in a single line replacing the multiline)
	e.g. min = a if a < b else b
	
	
Data Types:
Data types are classification or categorization of data items. 
Data types are used to define the type of a variable.
- Numeric 	(int, float, complex)
- Sequence	(string, list, tuple)
- Dictionary
- Boolean
- Set

Mutable : 		object allows to changing a value without affecting object's identity
Immutable :  	object doesn't allow to cahanging value, will affect the object's identity


String:
string(data structure) represents a sequence of characters.
string is Immutable data type

practice on string functions


List:
List is collection of objects, enclosed in [] and seperated by commas(,) - just like dynamic size of an array
List is non-homogeneous  - it may contain mixed data types (int, string and objects)
List is mutable - can be altered even after creation
List comprehension - creating a new list from other iterables like tuples, strings, arrays, list, etc.

practice on List functions


Tuple:
Tuple is similar like List collection of python objects, but the main difference is, tuples are Immutable, once decleare we can't modify.
Also compare to list accessing data from tuple is fast. 

practice on Tuple functions


Set:
set is an unordered collection data type that is mutable and has no duplicate elements
since sets are unordered, we can't access the data like list

practice on set functions

Stack:
Stack works on the principle of “Last-in, first-out”.

Queue:
Queue works on the principal of "First in first out"
